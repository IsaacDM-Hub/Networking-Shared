## PDU protocol data unit
session-application = data
transport = segment/datagram
network = packet
data link = frame 
physical = bit

## internet standard orgs
IETF = RFCS
IANA - internet numbers
  # in charge of ips and domains, who has what ip
IEEE - LAN/WAN electrical standards
  # responsible for maintaining standards and protocols

========================Layer 1 (physical)========================

# bits are at this level
# binary, decimal, hex, base64
# binary:
  word = 32 bits
  half word = 16 bits
  byte = 8
  nibbles = 4
# hexadecimal:
  base16 (0-9 and A-F)
# base64 (A-Z a-z 0-9 + /)
  uses = to show a null value with a max of 2

# bus topology
  straight line, half-duplex
# star topology
  switch at the center where everything is plugged into it
# ring toplogy
   keys are shared among connected devices 
# mesh topology
  everyone is connected to everyone else, or some are connected to others
# wireless 
  devices are connected to a modem
# hierarchal 
  used at an enterprise level, different layers and uses firewalls
