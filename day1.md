## PDU protocol data unit
session-application = data
transport = segment/datagram
network = packet
data link = frame 
physical = bit

## internet standard orgs
IETF = RFCS
IANA - internet numbers
  # in charge of ips and domains, who has what ip
IEEE - LAN/WAN electrical standards
  # responsible for maintaining standards and protocols

========================Layer 1 (physical)========================
# bits are at this level
# binary, decimal, hex, base64
# binary:
  word = 32 bits
  half word = 16 bits
  byte = 8
  nibbles = 4
# hexadecimal:
  base16 (0-9 and A-F)
# base64 (A-Z a-z 0-9 + /)
  uses = to show a null value with a max of 2
# bus topology
  straight line, half-duplex
# star topology
  switch at the center where everything is plugged into it
# ring toplogy
   keys are shared among connected devices 
# mesh topology
  everyone is connected to everyone else, or some are connected to others
# wireless 
  devices are connected to a modem
# hierarchal 
  used at an enterprise level, different layers and uses firewalls

## devices
hubs: 
everyone gets everything (doesnt check frames that are sent)
sends to all ports (has packet collision)

repeater:
strengthens the signal by repeating it to reach a greater distance

switches:
similar to hubs but organizes based off collision domains, knows and keeps mac addresses so prevents packet collisions, dont go between networks

routers:
allows you to move across networks 

## ethernet timing (bit times)
Speed        Bit-Time
10Mbps       100ns
100Mbps      10ns
1 Gps        1ns
10 Gbps     .1ns
100 Gbps    .01ns


=====================layer 2 Data-link=============================
## MAC
  goes up the layer model from 2 to 3, holds alot of information
## LLC
  goes down the layers, from 2 to 1, 

moving between layers is called encapd/ecapsulation  

## switch operation
  # build MAC Address (CAM) Table
    > # Learns by reading source MAC Addresses
  # Forwarding Frames
    > # Decision based on destination MAC Address
  # switching modes
    cut through
      default method*
      only checks the destination MAC*
    Fragment free
      Stores first 64 bytes of the frame (Ethernet portion) before forwarding*
    Store-and-Forward
       Information is kept and sent at a later time to the destination*
## CAM table overflow attack
  sends frames with fake source MAC addresses to switch 
  cause switch to fill table with fake addresses
  switch wont be able to learn new valid addresses

## MAC Addressing
on windows uses - for every 2 chars
on unix uses : for every 2 chars
Cisco uses . for every 4chars
> Length:  48-bit | 6 byte | 12 Hex

## MAC address Types
  > Unicast: One to One
    > # 8TH bit is off
  > Multicast: One to Many
    > # 8TH bit is on
  > Broadcast: One to All
    > # All bits on

## Ethernet Header and Frame
> Mac Header/Trailer: 14 Bytes
> Data: 46-1500 Bytes
> EtherType
  > 0x0800 - IPv4
  > 0x0806 - ARP
  > 0x86DD - IPv6
  > 0x8100 - VLAN (important)

## MAC spoofing 
  changes MAC address

## VLAN
# Splitting up a switch into virtual ports
> Trunk Link
  > # Joining two switches together with VLAN Ports as if they were physically connected with ethernet
> Types
  > # Default: VLAN 1
  > # Data - User Traffic
  > # Voice - VOIP Traffic
  > # Management - Switch and router managment
  > # Native - Untagged switch and router traffic
> Headers
  > # Header length is: 32 bits
  > # 802.1Q
  > # 802.1AD
> VLAN Hopping Attack
  > # Switch Spoofing (DTP)
  > # Single Tagging
  > # Double Tagging (using native VLAN) and only works with a direct connection one of the vlans

## ARP
> Types
  > ARP (OPcode 1 and 2)
    > # Requests info. Example: knows ip asks for mac (Location)
  > RARP (OPcode 3 and 4)
    > # The client requesting an IP Address from the server's gateway
  > Proxy ARP (OPcode 2)
    > # The host answering the ARP Request from whatever asked where they were
  > Gratuitous ARP (OPcode 2)
    > # The host broadcasts their location without the request
> ARP Cache
    > # A tables that has translations in it
    > # Collection of Address Resolution Protocol Entries
    >     last from 2-20 mins
    >     default gateway is always present bare min
# poison arps cache with gratuitous and proxy arp

# Man-In-The-Middle With ARP
   Causes victim machines to populate their ARP Cache with the MAC Address of the attacker's machine instead of the local router's MAC Address

## VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
  > # Dynamically add/remove/modify VLANs
> is Cisco Proprietary
> Modes
  > Server: central management  
  > Client: pulls from server
  > Transparent: ignore server
> Vulnerablities
  > Spoofing Attacks
  > can cause switches to dump all VLAN info 

## Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
> # Used to dynamically create trunk links
> # 2 modes:
>   dynamic auto: default, makes it willing to be a trunk port
>   dynamic desirable: tries to convert to a trunk 
> Vulnerabilities
  > # Can send crafted messages to form a VLAN trunk link
  > # On By Default
  > # Recomment to:
    > # Disable and manually access trunk link

## CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
  # Network Discovery tool or admins that identifies the neighbors
## FDP (Foundry Discovery Protocol)
  # Proprietary data link layer protocol
## LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)
  # Neighbors are able to find each other on the local network (principally wired Ethernet)
# vulnerabilities: 
  leaks valuable info, clear text, enabled by default, may require them for VIP

## Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
  # Layer 2 network protocol used to prevent looping within a network topology 
  # Always forward traffic in specific patterns
  # packets stuck in a loop is a broadcast storm
	  > # STP is a method to prevent this as it disables temporarily any link that is not the best route out. Redundancy can still be in place as a backup

> ## Types
  > # 802.1D STP
  > # Per VLAN Spanning Tree + (PVST+)
  > # 802.1w - Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)
  > # Rapid per VLAN Spanning Tree + (RPVST+)
  > # 802.1s (Multiple Spanning Tree)
> route bridge selection route out of the network
> spanning tree attack
	# can craft a bpdu (bridge protocol data units) to deny service with a false/erroneous/spoofed bridge

## Port Security modes
	> # Restrict â€“ block without shutting down
	> # protect- lets through but logs the mac
	> # shutdown â€“ is shutdown (default)
> ## Vulnerabilities to port security
  > # Dependent on MAC Addresses
  > # MAC Spoofing

## Routing Protocol
> # Used Between Layer 3 devices to learn and advertise routes and maintain routing tables
> # Routes a routed protocol for learning and maintaining routing table
## Routed Protocol
> # Used between Routers to direct use traffic. It is also called network protocols
> # Routed by routing protocols


IGP and EGP
> IGP (Interior Gateway Protocols)
  > # Routing protocols that are used within an Autonomous System (AS).
  > # Referred to as intra-AS routing.
  > # Organizations and service providers IGPs on their internal networks.
  > # IGPs include RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and IS-IS.
> EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocols)
  > # Used primarily for routing between autonomous systems.
  > # Referred to as inter-AS routing.
  > # Service providers and large companies will interconnect their AS using an EGP.
  > # The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the only currently viable EGP and is the official routing protocol used by the Internet.
> OSPF: cost
> RIPv2: hop
> EIGRP: bandwidth,delay,load,reliability
> ISIS
> BGP: policy

Distance Vector Routing Protocols
> # They share entire routing tables with their directly connected neighbors and from these shared tables they determine:
  > Distance
    > # How far away the destination network is from the outer and is based on a metric such as the hop count, cost, bandwidth, delay
  > Vector
    > # Specifies direction to the remote network
Link State Routing Protocols
>  Each router receives an LSA (Link State Adverstisement) and begins to build a map of the entire network


Routing Protocol Vulnerabilities
> DDOS
> Packet Mistreating Attacks (PMA)
> Routing Table Poisoning (RTP)
> Hit and Run DDOS (HAR)
> Persistence Attacks (PA)


BGP
> # Roadmap of the internet
> # Routes traffic between AS Number
> # Advertises IP CIDR address blocks
> # Establishes Peer relationships
> # Complicated Configuration
> # Complicated and slow path selection
> BGP Hijacking
  > # This works by illegitimate advertising of addresses, and takes over the CIDR address blocks corrupting the internet routing tables by falsifying the advertising addresses


Static Routing
> # Manually Configured routes
> # They dont advertise over the network
> # They dont use bandwidth


Dynamic Routing
> # Discover new remote networks
> # Maintaining current routing information
> # Choose the best path to remote networks
> # Recalculate a new path to a remote network should the primary fail
