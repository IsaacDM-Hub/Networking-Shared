Utilize the targets T2 and RELAY to develop the following netcat relays for use by Gorgan Cyber Forces. The use of names pipes should be utilized on RELAY:

Syntax for steghide tool:
steghide extract -sf [image name]
Passphrase: password

    The Donovian Insider provided a image called 1steg.jpg on T2 and is trying to connect to RELAY on TCP port 1234 to send the file. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to accept this connection and forward to T1. Once the images are downloaded you will use a command-line tool called steghide to extract the message.
